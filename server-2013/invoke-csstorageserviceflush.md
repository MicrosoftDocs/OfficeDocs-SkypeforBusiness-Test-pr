Flushes the Lync Server Storage Service database on each Front End server in a pool. Flushing a database involves writing all the queued data to disk, and then clearing the database queue. This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.

<div>

## Syntax

    Invoke-CsStorageServiceFlush -FlushType <FullFlush | SteadyStateFlush> -PoolFqdn <Fqdn> [-Binding <String>] [-Force <SwitchParameter>] [-HostNameStorageService <String>] [-WaitTime <TimeSpan>]

## Examples

<div>

## Example 1

The command shown in Example 1 performs a “steady state” flush of the Storage Service databases found on the pool atl-cs-011.litwareinc.com. In a steady state flush, the only data removed from the queue (and written to disk) is data that can be removed without affecting the database operation.

    Invoke-CsStorageServiceFlush -PoolFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -FlushType "SteadyState"

## Detailed Description

The Lync Server Storage Service provides a common interface and infrastructure for managing Lync Server data, including session data for monitoring, archiving, and conversation history, as well as for integrating with the Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 storage system. Like other databases, the Storage Service caches data in memory and then, as system resources permit, periodically writes that data to disk.

As a general rule, administrators do not have to interact with this queued data. However, there could be times when the queue becomes too large or because the Registrar pool associated with the database is being failed over. In cases like that, the **Invoke-CsStorageServiceFlush** cmdlet can be called in order to write all the queued data to disk and then clear the database cache.

The **Invoke-CsStorageServiceFlush** cmdlet is also useful when multiple Front End servers must be shut down at the same time (for example, in order to do a software upgrade). As a general rule, Front End servers in a pool should be shut down, and restarted, one-by-one; that helps prevent data loss that could occur due to routing group rebalancing. However, there might be occasions when you need to shutdown multiple servers at the same time. To help guard against potential loss, you can run the **Invoke-CsStorageServiceFlush** cmdlet before doing the computer shutdowns. This will flush the queue for the pool and write all that data to disk before any of the servers are actually shut down.

To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell command-line interface prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$\_.Cmdlets –match "Invoke-CsStorageServiceFlush"}

**Lync Server Control Panel:** The functions carried out by the **Invoke-CsStorageServiceFlush** cmdlet are not available in the Lync Server Control Panel.
