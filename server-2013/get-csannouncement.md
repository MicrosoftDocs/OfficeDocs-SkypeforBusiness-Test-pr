Returns information about the Lync Server announcements configured for use in your organization. Announcements are played when users dial a valid but unassigned phone number. An announcement can be a message (such as "This number is temporarily out of service") or a busy signal. This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.

<div>

## Syntax

    Get-CsAnnouncement [-Identity <XdsIdentity>] <COMMON PARAMETERS>

    Get-CsAnnouncement [-Filter <String>] <COMMON PARAMETERS>

    COMMON PARAMETERS: [-LocalStore <SwitchParameter>]

</div>

<div>

## Examples

<div>

## EXAMPLE 1

Example 1 returns all of the announcements configured for use in the organization. This is done by calling the **Get-CsAnnouncement** cmdlet without any parameters.

    Get-CsAnnouncement

</div>

<div>

## EXAMPLE 2

The command shown in Example 2 returns a single announcement: the announcement with the Identity ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com/1951f734-c80f-4fb2-965d-51807c792b90. For an alternate (and arguably easier) way to retrieve a specific announcement, see Example 5.

    Get-CsAnnouncement -Identity "ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com/1951f734-c80f-4fb2-965d-51807c792b90" 

</div>

<div>

## EXAMPLE 3

The command shown in Example 3 returns information about all of the announcements that have been configured for use on the service ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com.

    Get-CsAnnouncement -Identity "ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com"

</div>

<div>

## EXAMPLE 4

In Example 4, information is returned for all of the announcements configured for use in the Redmond site (on all domains). This is done by including the Filter parameter and the filter value "\*ApplicationServer:Redmond\*", which limits the returned data to announcements that have an Identity that contains the string value "ApplicationServer:Redmond". By definition, those are announcements configured for use in the Redmond site.

    Get-CsAnnouncement -Filter "*ApplicationServer:Redmond*"

</div>

<div>

## EXAMPLE 5

Example 5 shows an alternate way to return a specific announcement or set of announcements; in this case, all announcements named Welcome Announcement. To do this, the **Get-CsAnnouncement** cmdlet is first called, without any parameters, in order to return a collection of all the announcements in use in the organization. This collection is then piped to the **Where-Object** cmdlet, which picks out those announcements that have a Name equal to (-eq) "Welcome Announcement".

    Get-CsAnnouncement | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "Welcome Announcement"}

</div>

<div>

## EXAMPLE 6

Example 6 in similar to Example 5, but this example shows another way to return a single announcement. We once again call the **Get-CsAnnouncement** cmdlet, but this time we specify an Identity of ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com. This will return a collection of all announcements associated with that service. As in Example 5, this collection is then piped to the **Where-Object** cmdlet, which picks out those announcements that have a Name equal to (-eq) "Welcome Announcement". Because announcement names must be unique within an Application service, this command will never return more than a single item.

    Get-CsAnnouncement -Identity "ApplicationServer:redmond.litwareinc.com" | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "Welcome Announcement"}

</div>

<div>

## EXAMPLE 7

This example is similar to Example 5 in that we retrieve all the announcements, then pipe the collection of announcements to the **Where-Object** cmdlet. However, in Example 5 we used the –eq operator in the where clause to find an identical match for the name. In this example we’ve used the –like operator and a wildcard value to find all announcements that, in this case, begin with the string Welcome.

    Get-CsAnnouncement | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "Welcome*"}

</div>

<div>

## EXAMPLE 8

In Example 8, information is returned for all the announcements that use a text-to-speech (TTS) prompt (either as the primary announcement or as a fallback to an audio file) but do not use U.S. English as their language. To carry out this task, the command first calls the **Get-CsAnnouncement** cmdlet in order to return a collection of all the announcements currently configured. This collection is then piped to the **Where-Object** cmdlet, which selects all the announcements where the TextToSpeechPrompt property is not empty (not equal to $Null) and where the Language property is not equal to (-ne) en-US.

    Get-CsAnnouncement | Where-Object {($_.TextToSpeechPrompt -ne $Null) -and ($_.Language -ne "en-US")}

</div>

</div>

## Detailed Description

An organization can own phone numbers that are not assigned to users or phones, but that are still valid numbers that can be called. By default, when someone dials one of those numbers, that person will receive a busy signal and the call may result in an error returned to the SIP client. By applying announcement settings to unassigned numbers, administrators have the option of playing a message, returning a busy signal, or redirecting the call. This cmdlet retrieves one or more of these announcement settings.

Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the **Get-CsAnnouncement** cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalUserAdmins, RTCUniversalServerAdmins. To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$\_.Cmdlets –match "Get-CsAnnouncement"}

<p>- Enter the Identity of the Application service for the announcements you want to retrieve. This will retrieve all announcements configured with the given service Identity. For example, ApplicationServer:Redmond.litwareinc.com.</p>
<p>- Enter the full Identity of the single announcement you want to retrieve. This value will always be in the format &lt;serviceID&gt;/&lt;GUID&gt;, where serviceID is the Identity of the Application Server running the Announcement Service and GUID is a globally unique identifier associated with this announcement.
