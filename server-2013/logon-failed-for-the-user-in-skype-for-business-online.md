When you attempt to make a remote connection to Skype for Business Online, you must supply the user name and password of a valid Skype for Business Online user account. If you do not, logon will fail along with an error message similar to this:

    Get-CsWebTicket : Logon failed for the user 'kenmyer@litwareinc.com'. Please create a new PSCredential object, making sure that you have used the correct user name and password.

If you think that you are using a valid user account and that you have the correct password, try logging on again. If that fails, use the same credentials and try to log on at <https://login.microsoftonline.com/>. If you are unable to log on there, contact Office 365 Support.
